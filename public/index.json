Before, atlas used to be a rocket fuel for even a dual core intel CPU. It had the most optimized tweaks than other OS\u0026rsquo;s/modifications.\nThey even had ISO\u0026rsquo;s which made them easy to install. But now they give a playbook with AME wizard which is programmed to run by itself on configuring the playbook file. I had sometimes encountered bugs such that I had to do the whole process of modifying windows again.\nMoreover, they have compromised performance for compatibility. Overall, the updates had not impressed me and it is not good as it was before.\nWhat can you choose as an alternative? 🤔 #\rMainly, you could tweak your PC yourself, provided you know to troubleshoot and have a better understanding of tweaking and stuffs.\nNever tweak your PC unnecessarily if you do not know how it affects your PC.\rHere are some of the videos I found for a full guide on tweaking the PC yourself.\nCredit : Nico Knows Tech\nCredit : Khorvie Tech\nNote: These guides can break your computer if not done correctly!\rConclusion #\rNowadays computer has become an essential part of our daily life. Atlas has been its prime before, but it has also started compromising performance. This decision led to the lack in performance of low-end PC\u0026rsquo;s. So tweaking windows by yourself (ie which tweaks you need and which you not) is the best option in my opinion. Until next time, happy gaming, respect your parents, take care and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see you in the next one.

Do you crave a faster, more optimized computing experience tailored to your needs, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a gamer, a programmer, or a power user? Look no further! In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the world of custom Windows operating systems and provide you with detailed recommendations to supercharge your PC\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nThe Downside of Stock Windows #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s kick things off by addressing why stock Windows might not be your best choice. When you first boot up a fresh Windows installation, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely notice that your system\u0026rsquo;s performance isn\u0026rsquo;t as snappy as you\u0026rsquo;d expect. Microsoft packs a lot of bloatware into Windows, slowing it down and increasing the chances of software crashes. This not only frustrates users but also takes a toll on your computer\u0026rsquo;s overall performance.\nThe Advantages of Custom Windows Operating Systems #\rCustom Windows operating systems come to the rescue! These tailored OS options can provide a significant performance boost, making your PC feel like a brand-new machine. Here are some of the benefits you can expect:\nFaster boot times Reduced latency and more stable frames in games Smoother animations Fewer background processes Lower CPU and GPU usage, freeing up more RAM for your applications Whether you have a high-end gaming rig or a budget-friendly PC, these custom OS options can deliver improved performance across the board.\nWindows 11 vs. Windows 10 #\rNow, the big question: Windows 11 vs. Windows 10. Windows 11 boasts better optimization claims, but is it the right choice for everyone? In our experience, Windows 10 offers a more stable and smoother experience, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re using a high-refresh-rate monitor. However, the choice ultimately comes down to personal preference.\nFor those who are enthusiastic about Windows 11 and its new animations and features, we\u0026rsquo;ve got recommendations for the best custom Windows 11 operating systems:\nGhost Spectre: Provides a bloatware-free experience, with the option to use Windows Defender for security.\nRevi OS: Another speedy choice, although you\u0026rsquo;ll need external security software.\nCustom Windows 10 Operating Systems: The True Powerhouses #\rNow, let\u0026rsquo;s shift our focus back to Windows 10. It\u0026rsquo;s known for its snappy user interface and optimized experience. However, it does come with bloatware and lacks some of the gaming optimizations found in Windows 11. That\u0026rsquo;s where custom Windows 10 operating systems shine, and these options make Windows 11 look like a joke. Here are some top picks:\nGhost Spectre: Offers a secure and closest-to-stock Windows 10 experience.\nRevi OS: Strikes a good balance between security and performance.\nAtlas OS: Prioritizes features and compatibility while still providing solid security.\nGG OS and Fox OS: Secure options with a focus on minimalism.\nCategorizing the Custom Windows Operating Systems #\rNow, let\u0026rsquo;s delve deeper into the details by categorizing these custom Windows operating systems based on three key aspects:\nSecurity: #\rGhost Spectre ranks highest in security.\nRevi OS offers a good balance between security and performance.\nAtlas OS prioritizes features and compatibility but still provides solid security.\nGG OS and Fox OS are secure options but may have fewer features in this aspect.\nFeatures and Compatibility: #\rGhost Spectre leads the list here, thanks to its Ghost Toolbox offering a range of useful tools during installation.\nAtlas OS follows with a good set of configuration options.\nRevi OS also provides a decent selection of features and compatibility options.\nPerformance: #\rAtlas OS takes the lead in performance, offering a snappy and responsive Windows experience, quick boot times, and excellent gaming performance.\nRevi OS performs admirably, followed by GG OS, Fox OS, and Ghost Spectre.\nConclusion #\rIn conclusion, installing these custom operating systems won\u0026rsquo;t necessarily give you a massive FPS boost, but you can expect improved overall performance and stability. It\u0026rsquo;s all about finding the right balance for your needs. If you\u0026rsquo;re still uncertain about which custom OS to choose, consider joining our Discord community, where we\u0026rsquo;ll be active and available to assist you in making an informed decision.\nThe choice ultimately rests with you, but rest assured that any of these custom installations will provide a significant enhancement to your Windows experience. As for me, my current PC is running Atlas OS, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing a dedicated video about it soon.\nThat wraps up this blog post.

Whether you’re using a gamepad, a joystick for flight simulators, or a steering wheel and pedals for racing games, X360ce allows you to fully customize your setup for an optimal and immersive gaming experience.\nThe video and the instructions here will show you step-by-step how to configure X360ce, explain how to troubleshoot common issues, and provide advice on fine-tuning your controller for specific games.\nIf you prefer an alternative method with XOUTPUT software, please check out this linked article for more information: The Best Alternative for X360ce Software\r2 mins\rGaming\rController\rWindows\rAlso, ensure that you have Visual C Runtimes installed to avoid any issues. Find the guide here: FULLY Install VISUAL C++ Redistributable Runtimes All-in-One\r1 min\rWindows\rKey Features of X360ce Emulator: #\r1. Controller Compatibility #\rOne of the best features of X360ce is its wide support for various controller types. It doesn’t matter if you’re using a cheap third-party gamepad or a high-end joystick; X360ce is designed to work seamlessly with nearly any controller type, including:\nGamepads (including non-Xbox controllers) Joysticks (perfect for flight simulators or shooters) Steering wheels and pedals (for racing games or other vehicular experiences) This broad compatibility ensures you can use a wide range of external devices, even if the game doesn’t directly support your controller.\n2. Custom Button Mapping #\rX360ce gives you full control over your controller’s button layout:\nRemap buttons to any function that works best for your game. Adjust axes, such as throttle or steering, to fine-tune controls for maximum precision. Create game-specific profiles, which makes it easy to switch between different settings depending on the game you’re playing. This feature is ideal for gamers who like to personalize their controls and optimize their setup for different gaming experiences.\n3. Zero-Lag Emulation #\rOnce set up properly, X360ce ensures that your controller works just as if it was natively supported by the game. This means reduced input lag, which is essential for fast-paced competitive gaming like first-person shooters or racing games. With X360ce, your controller’s input is emulated with minimal delay, offering a smooth, responsive gaming experience.\n4. In-Game Customization #\rAlthough many games have built-in support for the Xbox 360 controller, X360ce provides an additional layer of customization:\nIf your game isn’t detecting your controller or mapping is incorrect, X360ce can adjust and convert the inputs into a format that the game recognizes. Customize and fine-tune settings to ensure optimal compatibility and performance. This customization option is a game-changer for users who are experiencing issues with their controller configuration, ensuring that you can enjoy an uninterrupted gaming experience.\nInstallation Guide #\rStep 1: Download X360ce Emulator #\rThe first step is to download the emulator from the official site:\nDownload X360CE\rStep 2: Extract and Launch #\rOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded the ZIP file, extract it and open the X360ce executable. The program will automatically scan for connected controllers and allow you to configure them.\nStep 3: Setting Up Your Controller #\rDetecting Your Controller: When you plug in your controller, X360ce will automatically recognize it. From there, you can map each button to the appropriate function. Customizing Settings: If you’re playing a game that requires specific inputs (such as a steering wheel for racing games), you can easily adjust the settings within the X360ce software. Step 4: Test and Play #\rYou can test your controller inputs directly in the X360ce interface by pressing buttons and seeing how they register. Once you’re satisfied with the configuration, launch your game. Your controller will now function just like an Xbox 360 controller, even if the game doesn’t natively support it.\nTroubleshooting Tips #\rHere are some common issues and solutions to help you troubleshoot if you encounter problems:\nGame Crashes on Launch: If your game crashes when trying to use the controller, ensure the X360ce version matches your game’s architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit).\nController Not Detected:\nMake sure the controller is properly connected and turned on. If it still isn’t detected, check for updated drivers for your controller, or try reconnecting it to a different USB port. Configuration Issues:\nIf your controller isn’t responding as expected, try deleting the current X360ce configuration files and setting it up again from scratch. This can often resolve many configuration conflicts. Controller Inputs Are Wrong: If buttons are mapped incorrectly, recheck the button assignments in the X360ce interface and make sure everything is set up correctly.\nJoin Our Discord for Extra Support #\rIf you run into any issues or have questions about setup or troubleshooting, feel free to join our Discord Community. I’m always happy to help, and our community members can provide advice as well.\nFinal Thoughts #\rThe X360ce Emulator is a must-have tool for PC gamers who want to use external controllers in games that don’t natively support them.
