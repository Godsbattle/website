## What is XOutput?

**XOutput** is a software tool that converts **DirectInput** into **XInput**. It reads DirectInput data and sends it to a virtual XInput (Xbox 360 Controller) device. **XInput** is the new standard game controller input on Windows, and with XOutput, you can still use **DirectInput** devices, which would otherwise be incompatible with many modern Windows applications.

## How to Use XOutput:

1. **Download XOutput**:
