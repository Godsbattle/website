## Why Hone?

Windows has the highest market share among operating systems, and to increase that share even further, it has incorporated various features that might be useful to some but unnecessary for others. These features, while beneficial, can often cause a need for more hardware resources, leading to slowdowns on systems with lower specs.

Many features in Windows OS are pre-packaged services and apps that can slow down boot times and consume system resources. Hone Optimizer helps reduce these lags and optimize your PC for better performance.
