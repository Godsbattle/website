The "Xbox 360 Controller Emulator" enables various controllers—such as gamepads, joysticks, steering wheels, and pedals—to function like an Xbox 360 controller. It offers the ability to remap buttons and axes, allowing you to drive cars with a steering wheel and pedals or fly planes with a joystick and throttle in games like "Grand Theft Auto" or "Saints Row." This article aims to detail the default X360ce settings for all PC games. If you're seeking a method to configure your PC to accept any external gamepad, there's no need for concern. Simply download the X360ce app onto your PC, and it will facilitate easier connection to the external pad.
