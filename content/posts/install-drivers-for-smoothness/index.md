**DISCLAIMER**:  
Before proceeding with installing drivers, itâ€™s important to **create a restore point** on your PC. While the driver installation process is generally safe, thereâ€™s always a slight risk of conflicts or issues arising during the installation. Creating a restore point will allow you to revert your system to its previous state if anything goes wrong. Itâ€™s a simple precaution to protect your data and ensure a hassle-free experience.  
You can easily create a restore point by searching for "Create a restore point" in the Start menu, then clicking "Create" in the System Properties window.
